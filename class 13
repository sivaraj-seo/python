#Write a Python program to print numbers from 0 to 9 using a for loop.

#Objective:
#To create a python program to print numbers from 0 to 9 using a for loop.

#Background:
#I’m using range() function in this program
#range() function in Python generates a sequence of numbers
#using print() function i’m print the values

#This problem helps beginners understand:
#how to use range() function
#how to use print() function

#Solution:
for i in range(3):
    print(i) 

#Write a Python program that uses a while loop to sum numbers from 1 to 100.

#Objective:
#To create a python program that uses a while loop to sum numbers from 1 to 100.

#Background:
#I’m using while function in this program
#while loop in Python is a control flow statement that repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition remains true.
#I’m assigning 2 variables a and i
#Through while i’m assigning i less and equal to 100
#I’m using an operator +=,  a += i is equivalent to a = a + i. It adds the value of i to the current value of a and then assigns the result back to a.
#i += 1 is a shorthand way of writing i = i + 1. It's used to increment the value of the variable i by 1.
#With the help of print() function, I’m print the value

#This problem helps beginners understand:
#how to use while function
#how to use += operator with variable
#how to use print() function

#Solution:

a = 0
i = 1
while i <= 100:
    a += i  
    i += 1

print("The sum is:", a)


#Write a Python program that uses a nested if to check if a number is positive, even, and divisible by 4.

#Objective:
#To create a python program that uses a nested if to check if a number is positive, even, and divisible by 4.

#Background:
#I’m using input() function to get the number from user
#if the result is 0, it prints the first print() function statement 
#I’m using multiple if statements to calculate the value
#And i’m writing a if statement with > operator for 1st condition
#And i’m writing a if statement with % and == operator for 2nd condition
#And i’m writing a if statement with % and == operator for 3rd condition
#I’m closing all the conditions with proper else statements
#else it’s prints the else print() function statement 

#This problem helps beginners understand:
#how to use multiple if-else statement
#how to use >, % and == operators
#how to use print() function

#Solution:

x = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if x > 0:
    print("This is positive number")
    if x % 2 ==0:
        print("This number is even")
        if x % 4 == 0:
            print("This number is divisible by 4")
        else:
            print("This number is not divisible by 4")
    else:
        print("This number is odd")
else:
    print("This is negative number")


#Write a Python program to use a while loop to print numbers greater than 10 but less than 20.
#Objective:
#To create a python program to use a while loop to print numbers greater than 10 but less than 20.

#Background:
#I’m using while function in this program
#while loop in Python is a control flow statement that repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition remains true.
#I’m assigning variable a is 20
#Through while i’m assigning a less 20
#I’m using an operator +=,  a += i is equivalent to a = a + i. It adds the value of i to the current value of a and then assigns the result back to a.
#With the help of print() function, I’m print the value

#This problem helps beginners understand:
#how to use while function
#how to use += operator with 1
#how to add a number to variable
#how to use print() function

#Solution:
	a = 10
while a < 20:
    a += 1
    print(a)


#Write a Python program to check if a number is both odd and divisible by 5 using nested if.

#Write a Python program to iterate over a list of integers and print all even numbers using a for loop.

#Objective:
#To create a python program to iterate over a list of integers and print all even numbers using a for loop.

#Background:
#I’m using for loop in this program
#for loop is used for iterating over a sequence
