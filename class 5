#Write a Python program to extract a substring from a string.

#Objective:
#To create a python program to extract a substring from a string.

#Background:
#I’m assigning a string in variable x
#By using a new string y i’m mentioning characters at positions, through this it fetch that particular position characters
#Using print() function i’m print the new variable y

#This problem helps beginners understand how to:
#how to use extract particular position substring
#how to use a new variable to print the result.

#Solution:

x = "Hello, Welcome to python"
y = x[7:15]

print(y)


#Write a Python program that removes leading and trailing spaces from a string.

#Objective:
#To create a python program to remove the spaces in a string.

#Background:
#I’m using input() function to get the user input in string
#strip() function removes leading and trailing spaces to return a copy of the original string
#I’m assigning y asa new variable to get the variable x with strip()
#I’m printing variable y.

#This problem helps beginners understand:
#how to use strip() function
#how to use a new variable to print the result.

#Solution:

x = input("Enter the string: ")
print(x)
y = x.strip()
print(y)


#Write a Python program to replace all occurrences of a word in a string.

#Objective:
#To create  a python program that replaces the existing string with a new string.

#Background:
#I’m assigning a string in x
#remove() function built-in string function that returns a new string with specified occurrences of an old substring replaced by a new substring.
#I’m assigning y as a new variable, and I'm mentioning replace() function with old and new substring.
#I’m printing variables x and y to show the difference.

#This problem helps beginners understand:
#how to use replace() function
#how to use a new variable to print the result.


x = "This is the string"
y = x.replace("the","is")

print("Before change: ", x)
print(y)



#Write a Python program to count the occurrences of a specific letter in a string.

#Objective:
#To write a python program that with count() function to count the occurrences of a specific letter in a string

#Background:
#I’m assigning a string in x
#count() method in Python is used to count the number of occurrences of a specified value within a string, list, or tuple.
#I’m assigning y as a new variable, and I'm using the count() function with old and new substring.
#I’m printing y to show the occurrences of particular letters.

#This problem helps beginners understand:
#how to use count() function
#how to print occurrences of particular letters.


x = "This is the string"
y = x.count("i")

print(y)



#Write a Python program to check the length of a string using len().
#Objective:
#To write a python program that checks the length of a string using len().

#Background:
#I’m using input() function to get the user input in string
#len() function returns the number of items in an object.
#I’m assigning y as a new variable, and I'm using the len() function with old variable
#I’m printing y to show the occurrences of length of a string.

#This problem helps beginners understand:
#how to use len() function
#how to print occurrences of length of a string.

#Solution:

x = input("Enter a value: ")
y = len(x)
print(y)

#Write a Python program to convert a string into a list of words.

#Objective:
#To write a python program that converts the string as a list of words.

#Background:
#I’m using input() function to get the user input in string
# the split() method is a built-in string method that is used to split a string into a list of substrings based on a specified delimiter
#I’m assigning y as a new variable.
#I’m printing y to print the result as a list.

#This problem helps beginners understand:
#how to use split() function
#how to print the converted list.

#Solution:

x = input("Enter a value: ")
y = x.split()
print(y)



#Write a Python program that concatenates two strings using + operator.

#Objective:
#To write a python program that concatenates two strings using + operator

#Background:
#In this program i’m concatenating two strings
#In python concatenating is adding two separate string value as one
#I’m getting two strings from the user through using the input() function.
#Through the print function I’m concatenating x and y with the help of sum (+) operator. 

#This problem helps beginners understand:
#how to understand concatenate two strings
#how to assign two strings
#how to print the concatenated string

#Solution:
x = input("Enter a string: ")
y = input("Enter a string: ")

print(f"this is concatenated string: {x}" + f" {y}")


#Write a Python program to slice a string and display the first 3 characters.

#Objective:
#To write a python program that slice a string and display the first 3 characters

#Background:
#I’m using input() function to get the user input in string
#By using [0:2] it is slicing from index 0 up to but not including index 2.
#This extracts the first two elements of x
#By using the print function, I’m printing the slicing result.

#This problem helps beginners understand:
#how to slice a string 
#how to use the print function and print the result.

#Solution:
x = input("Enter a string: ")
print(x[0:2])
