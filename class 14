#Write a Python program to print "Welcome to Python" and stop the program using break statement.

#Objective:
#To create a python program to print "Welcome to Python" and stop the program using break statement.

#Background:
#I’m using break() function in this program with while
#break keyword is used to break out a for loop, or a while loop.
#while loop in Python is a control flow statement that repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition remains true.
#using print() function i’m print the values

#This problem helps beginners understand:
#how to use break in while loop
#how break keyword works
#how to use print() function

#Solution:	
	while True:
    print("Welcome to Python")
    break


#Write a Python program to print numbers from 1 to 10, but skip printing number 7 using the continue statement.

#Objective:
#To create a python program to print numbers from 1 to 10, but skip printing number 7 using the continue statement.

#Background:
#I’m using range() function in this program
#range() function in Python generates a sequence of numbers
#I’m using the continue statement. The continue statement is a control flow statement that skips the particular iteration of a loop and moves to the next iteration.  
#using print() function i’m print the values

#This problem helps beginners understand:
#how to use range() in for loop 
#how to use continue statement, how continue works
#how to use print() function

#Solution:	

	for i in range(10):
    if i == 7:
        continue
    print(i)


#Write a Python program that does nothing (using pass) when a condition is met.

#Objective:
#To create a python program that does nothing (using pass) when a condition is met.

#Background:
#I’m using range() function in this program
#range() function in Python generates a sequence of numbers
#I’m using the pass statement. The pass statement is a null operation; when it is executed, nothing happens.
#using print() function i’m print the values

#This problem helps beginners understand:
#how to use range() in for loop 
#how to use pass statement, how pass statement works
#how to use print() function

#Solution:

for i in range(10):
    if i == 7:
        pass
    print(i)
	
#Write a Python program to print numbers from 1 to 5, then stop the loop once it reaches number 4 using break.

#Objective:
#To create a python program to print numbers from 1 to 5, then stop the loop once it reaches number 4 using break.

#Background:
#I’m using while function in this program
#while loop in Python is a control flow statement that repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition remains true.
#I’m assigning variables a value is 0
#a += 1 is a shorthand way of writing a = a + 1. It's used to increment the value of the variable a by 1.
#Using == operator i’m creating a condition with break I’m creating a condition to break the iteration. 
#With the help of print() function, I’m print the value

#This problem helps beginners understand:
#how to use while function
#how to use += and == operator with variable
#how to use print() function

#Solution:

a = 0
while a < 100:
    a += 1
    if a == 4:
        break
    print(a)


#Write a Python program to calculate the division of two numbers using Arithmetic Operators (/).

#Objective:
#To create a python program to calculate the division of two numbers using Arithmetic Operators (/).

#Background:
#I’m using input() function to get the values from user
#Using / operator I’m dividing the numbers
#With the help of print() function, I’m print the value

#This problem helps beginners understand:
#how to use input() function
#how to use print() function
#how to use / operator

#Solution:

x = int(input("Enter 1st number: "))
y = int(input("Enter 2nd number: "))
z = x / y

print(f"{x} divided by {y} is: {z}")


#Write a Python program that compares two numbers using Comparison Operators (>=) and prints a message if the first is greater than or equal to the second.

#Objective:
#To create a python program that compares two numbers using Comparison Operators (>=) and prints a message if the first is greater than or equal to the second.

#Background:
#I’m using input() function to get the values from user
#Using >= operator in if-else statement to compare x and y
#With the help of print() function, I’m print the value

#This problem helps beginners understand:
#how to use input() function
#how to use print() function
#how to use >= operator
#how to use if-else statement

#Solution:

x = int(input("Enter 1st number: "))
y = int(input("Enter 2nd number: "))
if x >= y:
    print(f"X {x} greater than Y {y} ")
else:
    print(f"X {x} is not greater than Y {y} ")


#Write a Python program to assign a value to a variable and increment it using the Assignment Operator (+=).

#Objective:
