#Write a Python program to convert a string into a float and then multiply it by 10.

#Objective:
#To create a python program that convert a string into a float and then multiply it by 10

#Background:
#I’m using input() function to get the user input in string
#By using a new string y i’m mentioning it as float that means i’m converting it as float.
#Using print() function i’m print the new variable y
#I’m assigning new variable z to multiply y with 10
#Using print() function i’m printing the result, new variable z

#This problem helps beginners understand:
#how to use input() function
#how to use new variables, and convert a variable into a new function.
#how to use operator * (multiply) operator.


x = str(input("Enter a string: "))
y = float(x)
print(y)

z = y*10
print(z)


#Write a Python program to check if a variable is True or False based on its value.

#Objective:
#To create a python program to check if a variable is True or False based on its value.

#Background:
#I’m using input() function to get the user input in integer
#By comparing two integers it gives a result in boolean.
#A boolean in Python represents one of two values: True or False
#Using if statement it print the boolean value
#I mentioned boolean value in print() function, it helps us to get the result

#This problem helps beginners understand:
#How boolean function works
#how to use if statement
#how to boolean prints its value

x = input("Enter a number: ")
y = input("Enter a number: ")

if x < y:
    print(bool(0))
else:
    print(bool(1))


#Write a Python program to create a list of strings and access the first item.

#Objective:
#To create a Python program that create a list of strings and access the first item

#Background:
#I have create a list of strings
#I have using list indexing to print the first string in the list

#This problem helps beginners understand:
#how to create a string
#how to use list indexing
#how to print the list index value


subjects = ["science", "tamil","english","Maths"]
print(subjects[0])


#Write a Python program to remove the last element from a list.
#Objective:
#To create a Python program that remove the last element from a list

#Background:
#I have create a list of strings
#I have been using the pop() function to print the last string in the list.
#pop() is a built-in method in Python used to remove and return an element from a list or dictionary.
#I have been using the print() function to get the result.

#This problem helps beginners understand:
#how to create a list of string
#how to use pop()
#how to print the rest of the list strings


subjects = ["science", "tamil","english","Maths"]
removed = subjects.pop()

print(subjects)

	
#Write a Python program to add two lists and print the result.
#Objective:
#To create a Python program to add two lists and print the result

#Background:
#I have two create a list of strings
#I’m using + operator to add to two lists
#I have assigned new variable “added” to merge the lists
#pop() is a built-in method in Python used to remove and return an element from a list or dictionary.
#I have been using the print() function to get the result.

#This problem helps beginners understand:
#how to assign two lists
#how to assign new variable when adding two lists
#how + operator works

#Solution:

subjects = ["science", "tamil","english","Maths"]

subjects_2 = ["PT", "Social science"]

added = subjects + subjects_2

print(added)


#Write a Python program to check if a list contains a specific element.

#Objective:
#To create a Python program to check if a list contains a specific element

#Background:
#I have created list
#index() method returns the position, with the help of index i’m finding whether the element is in or not.
#When i’m using “tamil” in the index it tries to find it.
#I have been using the print() function to get the result.

#This problem helps beginners understand:
#how to use index
#how to list the strings

#Solution:

x = ["science", "tamil","english","Maths"]
position = x.index("tamil")

print(position)


#Write a Python program that converts an integer into a string.

#Objective:
#To create a Python program that converts an integer into a string

#Background:
#I’m using input() function to get the integer value
#I’m assigning new variable x to convert it as string
#I am using the print() function to get the result.

#This problem helps beginners understand:
#how to convert the integer as string
#how to print the value
#how to use input() function

#Solution:

x = int(input("Enter a value: "))

y = str(x)
print(y)

#Write a Python program to demonstrate type() for a list and Boolean values.

#Objective:
#To create a Python program to demonstrate type() for a list and Boolean values.

#Background:
#I’m using input() function to get the user input in integer
#A list in Python collection of items 
#A boolean in Python represents one of two values: True or False
#Using type() function i’m printing the result

#This problem helps beginners understand:
#How to use type() function
#how to print the type() with print()


#Boolean:

x = input("Enter a number: ")
y = input("Enter a number: ")

if x < y:
    print(type(bool(0)))
else:
    print(type(bool(1)))

#List:

x = ["science", "tamil","english","Maths"]
print(type(x))
