#how to use print() function

#Solution:

x = int(input("Enter 1st number: "))
y = int(input("Enter 2nd number: "))
z = x - y

print(z)

#This problem helps beginners understand:
#how to use input() function
#how to use * operator
#how to use print() function

#Solution:

x = int(input("Enter width: "))
y = int(input("Enter length: "))

area = x * y

print(f"Area of rectangle {area}")

#Define a function that takes a string and returns it in uppercase.

#Using * operator, I’m multiplying x for soiree root
#With the help of print() function, I’m print the value

#This problem helps beginners understand:
#how to use input() function
#how to use * operator for soiree root
#how to use print() function

#Solution:
x = int(input("Enter number: "))
y = x*x
print (y)


#Create a function with default parameters where the default value of a message is "Hello, World!".

#Objective:
#To create a Python program that accepts a number and returns its square root.

#Background:
#This defines a function named x.
#It has one parameter, x, with a default value of "Hello, World!".
#With the help of print() function, I’m mentioning it as x

#This problem helps beginners understand:
#how to use input() function
#how to use print() function
#how to print the default value

#Solution:

def x(message="Hello, World!"):
    print(message)

x()
	

#Write a Python program where a function checks if a number is divisible by 3.

#Objective:
#To create a Python program that checks if a number is divisible by 3.

#Background:
#I have created input function() to get a integer value
#Using % and == operator, I’m confirming the entered number is divisible by 3
#Using if-else statement i’m checking the values
#With the help of print() function, I’m print the value

#This problem helps beginners understand:
#how to use input() function
#how to use % and == operator
#how to use print() function

#Solution:

x = int(input("Enter number: "))

if x % 3 == 0:
    print(f"Your number {x} divided by 3")
else:
    print(f"Your number {x} is not divided by 3'")


#Write a function that takes two numbers and returns the smaller of the two.

#Objective:
#To create a Python program that takes two numbers and returns the smaller of the two.

#Background:
#I have created input function() to get a two integer values
#Using < operator in if-else statement, I’m confirming which number is minimum
#With the help of print() function, I’m print the value

#This problem helps beginners understand:
#how to use input() function to get integer value
#how to use < operator
#how to use print() function

#Solution:

x = int(input("Enter 1st number: "))
y = int(input("Enter 2nd number: "))

if x < y:
    print(f"The minimum number your entered X {x}")
else:
    print(f"The minimum number your entered Y {y}")



#Create a program where a function takes a number and prints "Even" or "Odd" depending on the input.

#Objective:
#To create a python program that checks the number and prints "Even" or "Odd" depending on the input.


#Background:
#I have created input function() to get a integer value
#Using % and == operators in if-else statement, I’m confirming the number is even
#With the help of print() function, I’m print the value

#This problem helps beginners understand:
#how to use input() function to get integer value
#how to use % and == operator
#how to use print() function

#Solution:

	x = int(input("Enter a number: "))

if x % 2 == 0:
    print(f"{x} is even number")
else:
    print(f"{x} is a odd number")
