#Write a Python program to concatenate two strings.
#Objective:
#To concatenate two strings.

#Background:
#In this program i’m concatenating two strings
#in python concatenating is adding two separate string value as one
#I’m getting two strings from the user through using the input() function and adding those in z.
#Using the print() function I'm printing the concatenated result here. 

This problem helps beginners understand how to:
#how to understand concatenate two strings
#how to assign two strings
#how to print the concatenated string

#solution:
x = input("Enter the first string: ")
y = input("Enter the second string: ")
z = x + y

print("concatenation result: ", z)


#Write a Python program to check if a string is palindrome.
#Objective:
#To write a program that checks if the string is palindrome or not.

#Background:
#palindrome is an a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backwards as forwards
#I’m using the input() function to get the string input from the user.
#In this program I'm using  [::-1] expression slicing technique to reverse a string
#And I'm comparing both the input and reversed input using comparison operator (==) in the if statement.
#if the string are matching it prints The string is a palindrome, if not it prints the else statement The string is not a palindrome

#This problem helps beginners understand how to:
#How to use input() function
#How to reverse the text for
#how to use comparison operator for strings
#How to use if statement and print() function 

#solution:
text = input("Enter your text: ")
reversed_text = text [::-1]

if text == reversed_text:
    print("The string is a palindrome.")
else:
    print("The string is not a palindrome.")


#Write a Python program that demonstrates the replace() method on a string.
#Objective:
#To write a program that replaces the values in a set function. 

#Background:
#I'm creating a list[] with both numbers and strings. list[] is a mutable one, which means we can modify the values it has.
#By mentioning the position as x[2] and assigning a value for it as 99, I'm changing the value.

#This problem helps beginners understand how to:
#How to modify the list[] function
#How to print the value

#solution:
x = [2,12,"python","welcome",5.2]
x [2] = 99

print (x)


#Write a Python program to convert a string to lowercase.

#Objective:
#To covert the user input upper text into lower case

#Background:
#I’m using the input() function to get the text as capital. I’m mentioning it in prompt string
#By using lower() function I'm converting it into lower case. 
#I’m assigning the value into y and print the result using print() function.

#This problem helps beginners understand how to:
#This program helps to understand how to change the upper case text into lower case
#How to print the result using print() function
#How to assign the converted text into new variable


text = input("Enter your text in Capital: ")
y = text.lower()

print (y)


#Write a Python program that counts the number of occurrences of a substring in a string.

#Objective:
#To create a program that counts the number of substring 

#Background:
#I’m assigning list with some values
#with the help of new variable x i’m using count() function
#In count function i’m assigning a substring cherry
#with the help of print() function in print the number of occurrences

#This problem helps beginners understand:
#how to use count() function
#How to use list function
#how to use print() to print the occurrences
#How to assign new variable

#solution:
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
x = fruits.count("cherry")

print(x)


#Write a Python program that checks if a string contains a particular character.

#Objective:
#To create a program that checks if a string contains a particular character

#Background:
#I’m using input() function for both x and y
#In y variable i’m giving a particular character to find in x
#with the help of in operator with if-else statement i’m finding the y in x
#With the help of the print() function I'm printing the necessary output.

#This problem helps beginners understand how to:
#how to use input() function
#how to use a in operator in if-else statement
#how to check a character in particular string

#solution:
x = input("Enter a string: ")
y = input("Enter a character to check: ")

if y in x:
    print(f"The character '{y}' is present in the string.")
else:
    print(f"The character '{y}' is not present in the string.")



#Write a Python program to extract a substring from a given string.

#Objective:
#To create a program that  extract a substring from a given string

#Background:
#I’m assigning a string in variable x
#By using a new string y i’m mentioning characters at positions, through this it fetch that particular position characters
#Using print() function i’m print the new variable y

#This problem helps beginners understand how to:
#how to use extract particular position substring
#how to use a new variable to print the result.

#solution:
x= "welcome to ebay"
y = word[5:10]

print(y)


#Write a Python program that compares two strings and checks if they are equal.

#Objective:
#To create a python program that  compares two strings and checks if they are equal or not.

#Background:
#I’m using input() function for both x and y
#Using a comparison operator in the if-else statement to check if the string is equal or not.
#with the help of print() function i’m printing the necessary string literal

#This problem helps beginners understand:
#how to use comparison operator
#how to use a if-else statement
#how to use input() function

#solution:
x = input("Enter the first string: ")
y = input("Enter the second string: ")

if x == y:
    print("Both the strings are equal")
else:
    print("Both the strings are different")
