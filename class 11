#Write a Python program that writes data to a file and then reads the content.

#Objective:
#To create a python program that writes data to a file and then reads the content.

#Background:
#I’m using w+ in the statement to allow the file to read and write
#With the help of the read() function I'm reading the files from the hover and I'm assigning it in variable y.
#I’m printing the result with print() function

#This problem helps beginners understand:
#how to use writelines (w+)
#how to use read()
#how to use print() function

#Solution:

	with open('D:\\pythonExercisefile.txt', 'w+') as file:
    file.writelines("\n This is next line")
    file.seek(0)
    y = file.read()
    print(y)

#Write a Python program to append multiple lines to a file using writelines().

#Objective:
#To create a python program to append multiple lines to a file using writelines().

#Background:
#append() helps add multiple lines in the existing file.
#I’m using with open statement to open a mentioned file
#And i’m writing a new statement in that file using writelines
#I’m using \n to mention it as newlines

#This problem helps beginners understand:
#how to use writelines function
#how to write a multiple lines in that file
#how to use append() function

#Solution:

	with open('D:\\pythonExercisefile.txt', 'a') as file:
    file.writelines("This code opens example.txt in append mode ('a') \n"
                    " and adds a new line at the \n "
                    "end of the file without \n"
