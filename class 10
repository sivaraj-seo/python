#Write a Python program to open a file and write a string to it.

#Objective:
#To create a python program to open a file and write a string to it.

#Background:
#I’m using with open statement to open a mentioned file
#And i’m writing a new statement in that file

#This problem helps beginners understand:
#how to use with open
#how to write a new lines in that file

#Solution:

with open('D:\\pythonExercisefile.txt', 'w') as file:
  file.write("This is new file")

#Write a Python program to read the content of a file and print it on the screen.

#Objective:
#To create a python program to read the content of a file and print it on the screen.

#Background:
#I’m using with open statement to open a mentioned file
#I’m using writelines to write new lines in the file
#i’m using read() function to read the statements in the file, I’m assigning the result in variable z
#I’m printing the variable use print() function

#This problem helps beginners understand:
#how to use with writelines
#how to write a new lines in that file
#how to use read() function
#how to print the read() function result

#Solution:
	with open('D:\\pythonExercisefile.txt', 'r+') as file:
    file.writelines("This is \n new file")
    file.seek(0)
    y = file.read()
    print(y)

#Write a Python program to append new text to an existing file.
#Objective:
#To create a python program to append new text to an existing file.

#Background:
#append() method in Python adds a single element to the end of a list.
#I’m using with open statement to open a mentioned file
#And i’m writing a new statement in that file using writelines

#This problem helps beginners understand:
#how to use with writelines
#how to write a new lines in that file
#how to use append() function

#Solution:

	with open('D:\\pythonExercisefile.txt', 'a') as file:
    	file.writelines("new line added through append")

#Write a Python program that checks if a file exists before opening it.

#Objective:
#To create a python program that checks if a file exists before opening it.

#Background:
#I’m using check function to check the word in the mentioned file
#with open option, i’m opening the file add read the file
#using if statement i’m checking the statement in the file

#This problem helps beginners understand:
#how to assign file and keyword 
#how to open a file
#how to check the keyword in the file
#how to use if-else statement to print the result

#Solution:
	file = 'D:\\pythonfile.txt'
check = 'Hello'

with open(file, 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
if check in content:
    print("Yes, it's there")
else:
    print("No")

#Write a Python program to use seek() to move to a specific position in a file.

#Objective:
#To create a python program to use seek() to move to a specific position in a file.

#Background:
#seek() method in Python is used to change the position of the file handle to a specific point within a file.
#with open option, i’m opening the file r+ to read the file
#using seek() method i’m assigning a position to set the hover 
#With the help of the read() function I'm reading the files from the hover and I'm assigning it in variable y.
#I’m printing the result with print() function


#This problem helps beginners understand:
#how to open the file
#how to use writelines
#how to use seek()
#how to use print() function

#Solution:
	with open('D:\\pythonExercisefile.txt', 'r+') as file:
    file.writelines("This is \n new file")
    file.seek(0)
    y = file.read()
    print(y)

#Write a Python program that uses read() and readline() to read data from a file.

#Objective:
#To create a python program that uses read() and readline() to read data from a file.

#Background:
#read() method reads the entire content of the file as a single string
#readlines() method reads all lines from the file and returns them as a list of strings
#I’m using with open statement to open a mentioned file
#With the help of read and readlines i’m getting the result.
#With the help of print() function, I'm getting the result.

#This problem helps beginners understand:
#how to use read() in the file
#how to use readlines() in the file

#Solution:

	with open('D:\\pythonfile.txt', 'r') as x:
    y = x.read()
    print(y)

	with open('D:\\pythonfile.txt', 'r') as x:
    y = x.readline()
    print(y)

#Write a Python program that reads multiple lines from a file using readlines() and prints each line.

#Objective:
#To create a python program that reads multiple lines from a file using readlines() and prints each line.

#Background:
#I’m using with open function to open a assigned file
#using new variable y i’m reading the file
#I’m getting the result with print() function

#This problem helps beginners understand:
#How to use readlines
#How to print the result

#Solution:

	with open('D:\\pythonfile.txt', 'r') as x:
    y = x.readlines()
    print(y)


#Write a Python program to close a file after performing read or write operations.

#Objective:
#To create a python program to close a file after performing read or write operations.

#Background:
#I’m using with close function to close the assigned file

#This problem helps beginners understand:
#how to close the file using close function
#Solution:

x = open('D:\\pythonfile.txt', 'r')
y = x.readlines()
print(y)
x.close()
