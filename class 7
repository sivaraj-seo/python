#Write a Python program to create a tuple and print all its elements.

#Objective:
#To create a Python program to create a tuple and print all its elements.

#Background:
#I’m creating tuple with strings and integer

#This problem helps beginners understand:
#how to create tuple
#how to print the tuple 

#Solution:

x = (25,2.3,61,"science","Maths")
print(x)

#Write a Python program that demonstrates set operations (union, intersection, and difference).

#Objective:
#To create a Python program that performs union, intersection, and difference

#Background:
#I have created two set
#With the help of sets i have performing the operations like union, intersection, and difference
#With assigning new variables set, set1 and set2 i’m printing the result.

#This problem helps beginners understand:
#how to create two sets
#how union, intersection, and difference are working
#how to create new variables
#how print() function works

	
x = {25,2.3,61,"science","maths"}
y = {1,2,3,61,"maths"}

set = x.union(y)
set1 = x.intersection(y)
set2 = x.difference(y)

print(set)
print(set1)
print(set2)



#Write a Python program to create a set and check if an element exists in it.

#Objective:
#To create a python program that create a set and check if an element exists in it

#Background:
#I’m using input() function to get the values for set and to check
#using in operator in if statement i’m checking the value is present in the set or not.

#This problem helps beginners understand:
#how to create a set
#how to check the set elements presents in the set

#Solution:

x = input("Enter values for set: ")
y = input("Enter values for check: ")
print(x)

if y in x:
    print("Yes, It has the value")
else:
    print("It hasn't")


#Write a Python program that creates a set from a list and prints it.

#Objective:
#To create a python program that creates a set from a list and prints it

#Background:
#I’m have created a list
#By assigning new variable y i’m converting it as set
#Then i’m printing the set with the help of print() function

#This problem helps beginners understand:
#how to create list
#how to convert the list as set
#how to print the set

#Solution:

x = [1,2,5,6,74,"python",6.5,"welcome"]

y = set(x)

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(x)
print(y)


#Write a Python program to demonstrate adding and removing elements from a set.
#Objective:
#To create a python program to demonstrate adding and removing elements from a set.

#Background:
#in this program i have created set
#using add operation i’m adding “hello” string
#using remove operation i’m removing integer “2”
#getting the result with print() function

#This problem helps beginners understand:
#how add and remove operations works
#how to create set
#how to print the added and removed set


x = {1,2,5,6,74,"python",6.5,"welcome"}
x.add("hello")
print(x)

x.remove(2)
print(x)

#Write a Python program to find the length of a tuple.
#Objective:
#To create a python program to find the length of a tuple

#Background:
#I’m creating a tuple
#By assigning new variable i’m getting the length of tuple

#This problem helps beginners understand:
#how to tuple works
#how to measure tuple length
#how to assign new variable, how to print the new variable

x = [1,2,5,6,74,"python",6.5,"welcome"]
y = len(x)
print(y)

	
#Write a Python program to perform set difference on two sets.

#Objective:
#To create a python program to perform set difference on two sets.

#Background:
#i’m creating two sets
#using the difference() operation i’m getting the differences of x and y

#This problem helps beginners understand:
#how to create two set
#how to differentiate two sets and print

Solution:
x = {1,2,5,6,74,"python",6.5,"welcome"}
y = {1,2,5.5,6,"python",65,"welcome"}

diff = x.difference(y)

print(diff )



#Write a Python program to iterate over a tuple and print each element.
#Objective:
#To create a python program to iterate over a tuple and print each element.

#Background:
#i’m creating a tuple with integer and strings
#with the help of for operation i’m assigning y as x
#with the use of print() function i’m getting the result

#This problem helps beginners understand:
#how to use tuple
#how to use for operation
#how to use print operation

#Solution:

x = [1,2,5,6,74,"python",6.5,"welcome"]
for y in x:
    print(y)
