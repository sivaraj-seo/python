#Write a Python program to check the data types of string, integer, and float.

#Objective:
#To write a python program that finds the data type of result.  

#Background:
#In this program I have created a user input code, through which I'm getting a result with the help of print() function.’
#With the print function I'm using type() that helps us to find which type the result represents. 
#In python type() is the option to find which data type the input represents.  

#Solution:

x = int(input("please enter a number :" ))
y = str(input("please enter a value :" ))

print(type(x))

print(type(y))


#Write a Python program that takes two inputs and adds them (integer and float).
#Objective:
#To create a program that adds integer type and float type numbers.	

#Background:
#In this program I'm adding two types of numbers (integer and float).
#Integer is a whole number, float is with decimal point. 
#I'm using the input() function to get the data from users, adding them with the arithmetic operator + (sum) and declaring the sum in  z.
#With the help of print() function i’m printing the value. 


#Solution:
x = int(input("please enter number a : " ))
y = float(input("please enter number b : " ))
z = x + y

print(f"Total of {x} and {y} is ", z)


#Write a Python program to perform operations between an integer and a float.
#Objective:
#To create a program that performs arithmetic and comparison operations.	

#Background:
#In these following programs I'm using arithmetic and comparison operations.
#In arithmetic operation I'm using the + (sum) operator to add two numbers. 
#In the comparison operation I'm using the == (comparison ) operator to check two numbers. 
#I'm declaring Z for arithmetic and Y for comparison to declare the result. 
#With the help of print() function i’m printing the value. 

#Arithmetic:

x = float(input("please enter number a : " ))
y = float(input("please enter number b : " ))

z = x + y

print(f"Total of {x} and {y} is ", z)

#Comparison:

x = float(input("please enter number a : " ))
y = float(input("please enter number b : " ))

if x == y:
    print (f"X is equal to Y")
else:
    print(f"X is not equal to Y")


#Write a Python program to demonstrate type casting (convert integer to float and vice versa).

#Objective:
#To create a program that has to convert one type of data type into another data type..	

#Background:
#In these following programs I'm getting input() from users in one data type.
#And print the data type in another data type by converting it. 
#By using a data type with print() function I'm converting the assigned value into another data type. 
#I'm declaring a and b to store the new data type values. 
#With the help of print() function i’m printing the value. 

x = float(input("please enter number a : " ))
y = int(input("please enter number b : " ))

a = int(x)
b = float(y)

print(a)
print(type(a))

print(b)
print(type(b))



#Write a Python program to check if a number is True or False based on Boolean values.

#Objective:
#To create a program that checks if the number is true or false based on Boolean value..	

#Background:
#In these following programs I'm getting input() from users.
#Boolean is a conditional logic, if a user's input value is zero it prints false otherwise true. 
#With the help of print() function i’m printing the value. 

	#Solution:

	num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

if bool(num):
    print("The number is True in Boolean.")
else:
    print("The number is False in Boolean.")


#Write a Python program to use type() to display the data type of an object.

#Objective:
#To create a program that checks users inputs data type..	

#Background:
#In these following programs I'm getting input() from users.
#With the help of the type() function I'm getting the data type of that input.
#I’m using the type() function with the print() function to print the value.

#Solution:

value = str(input("Enter a number: "))
print(type(value))

#Write a Python program to check if a given number is an integer, float, or string.

#Objective:
#To create a program that checks the user inputs data type.	

#Background:
#In these following programs I'm getting input() from users.
#try: statement is used to test a block of code for errors.
#except block catches and handles errors (exceptions) that happen inside the preceding try block. 
#It tries to convert the variable x into an integer.
#if the result is integer it prints the condition, if not it skips and checks the next condition. 
#with the help of print() it prints the result. 

#Solution:

x = input("Enter a value: ")

try:
    val = int(x)
    print("This is an integer")
except ValueError:
    try:
        val = float(x)
        print("This is a float")
    except ValueError:
        print("This is a string")

#Write a Python program to perform string concatenation and display the result.
#Objective:
#To add two strings and print it.

#Background:
#String concatenation is the process of combining two or more strings into a single string
#In these following programs I'm getting input() from users.
#concatenating two strings, and assigning it to z.
#with the help of print() i’m printing the result. 

#solution:

x = input("Enter the first string: ")
y = input("Enter the second string: ")

z = x + y

print("concatenation result: ", z)
