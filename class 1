#Write a Python program to perform subtraction between two numbers.

#Objective:
##Write a Python program to subtract one number from another and display the result.

#Background:

#In mathematics, subtraction is a basic arithmetic operation that represents the operation of removing objects from a collection. In programming, subtraction is performed using the - (minus) operator.

#This problem helps beginners understand how to:

#Declare and initialize variables
#Perform arithmetic operations in Python
#Display output using the print() function

x=5
y=10

z = x-y
print(z)


#Write a Python program that demonstrates type() with different variables.

#Objective: 
#Write a Python program that demonstrates type() with different variables.

#Background:

#This program explains which type of variable is used in the program. This helps us to find whether the input type matches with the requirement or not.

#Solution:
#Finding variables type
#Display output using the type() function

x=5
y=10

z = x-y
print(type(z))

print(type("hello world"))

#Result:
<class 'int'>
<class 'str'>


#Write a Python program to divide two numbers and print the quotient.
	
#Objective:
#Write a Python program to divide two numbers and print the quotient.

#Background:
#This program helps us to divide 2 numbers and print the quotient result. With the help of / operator we divide 2 numbers and print its result. 

#Solution:

x=50
y=10
z = (x/y)
print("quotient: ", z)

#Result:
quotient:  5.0

#Write a Python program that prints the sum of two numbers entered by the user.
#Objective:
#Write a Python program that prints the sum of two numbers entered by the user.

#Background:
#Sum operation helps us to add to numbers. In python we are using + operator to add two numbers. In this program we are adding 2 numbers with + operator and printing the result.

a = int(input("Enter value of a: "))
b = int(input("Enter value of b: "))

c = a+b

print("Total: ", c)

#Result:
Enter value of a: 15
Enter value of b: 15
Total:  30

#Write a Python program that asks for your name and age and prints both.

#Objective:
#Write a Python program that asks for your name and age and prints both.

#Background:
#Input() is the function used in python to get input from users. In this program we are using the input() function with string and integer arrays. 

a = str(input("Enter your name: "))
b = int(input("Enter age: "))

print("Your name is: ", a)
print("Your age is: ", b)

#Result:
Enter your name: Siva
Enter age: 25
Your name is:  Siva
Your age is:  25

#Write a Python program to calculate the product of two numbers.

#Objective:
#Write a Python program to calculate the product of two numbers.


#Background:
#In this program we have to calculate two numbers product using * operator. In this program i’m using the input() function integer array to get user input in numbers and get the result using print() function.  


a = int(input("Enter 1st value: "))
b = int(input("Enter 2nd value: "))

c = a * b

print("Product value: ", c)

#Result:
Enter 1st value: 15
Enter 2nd value: 62
Product value:  930
	
#Write a Python program that asks for two numbers and prints their difference.
#Objective:
#Write a Python program that asks for two numbers and prints their difference.

#Background:
#In this program we have to print the difference between 2 numbers. I’m using - operator to find the difference. 

a = eval(input("Enter 1st value: "))
b = eval(input("Enter 2nd value: "))
c = a - b
print(f"Difference between a {a} and b {b} is: ", c)

#Result:
Enter 1st value: 30
Enter 2nd value: 30
Difference between a 30 and b 30 is:  0
