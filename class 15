#Write a Python program to perform a bitwise XOR operation between 9 and 4 and print the result.

#Objective:
#To create a Python program to perform a bitwise XOR operation between 9 and 4 and print the result.

#Background:
#XOR operator in Python, denoted by the symbol ^, performs a binary XOR operation on the corresponding bits of two integers.
#I’m assigning variables a,b
#I’m assigning new variable c with the XOR operation
#With the help of print() function, I’m print the value

#This problem helps beginners understand:
#how to use variables
#how to use XOR operator
#how to use print() function

#Solution:
a = 9
b = 4
c = (a ^ b)
print(c)

#Write a Python program that checks if the number is even and divisible by 3 using the bitwise AND (&) operator.

#Objective:
#To create a Python program that checks if the number is even and divisible by 3 using the bitwise AND (&) operator.

#Background:
#I’m using input() function to get value from user
#Using % and == operator, In the statement I’m using Bitwise operator &
#Using the above operators I’m calculating the user entered number is even and divisible by 3
#I’m using if-else statement to perform this operation
#With the help of print() function, I’m print the value

#This problem helps beginners understand:
#how to use input() function
#how to use % and == operator
#how to use print() function

#Solution:
	
x = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if x % 2 ==0 & x % 3 == 0:
    print("This number is even and divisible by 3")
else:
    print("This number is not even and divisible by 3")


#Write a Python program that checks if a substring "code" is present in a string using the in operator.

#Objective:
#To create a Python program that checks if a substring "code" is present in a string using the in operator.

#Background:
#I’m using the input() function to get values from the user, I’m mentioning it as a string to ensure it’s text.
#Using in statement in if statement I’m checking the value is present
#I’m using if-else statement to perform this operation
#With the help of print() function, I’m print the value

#This problem helps beginners understand:
#how to use input() function to get string
#how to use in statement
#how to use if-else statement
#how to use print() function

#Solution:

x = str(input("Enter a text: "))
y = str(input("Enter a text to check: "))
if y in x:
    print("'TEXT' is present")
else:
    print("'TEXT' is not present")


#Write a Python program to check if the value 5 is not in a list of integers using not in.

#Objective:
#To create a Python program to check if the value 5 is not in a list of integers using not in.

#Background:
#I’m using the input() function to get values from the user, I’m mentioning it as an integer.
#Using NOT IN statement in if statement I’m checking the value is present
#I’m using if-else statement to perform this operation
#With the help of print() function, I’m print the value

#This problem helps beginners understand:
