#Write a Python program to check whether a number is even or odd using if-else.

#Objective:
#To create a Python program to check whether a number is even or odd using if-else

#Background:
#I’m using input() function to get the value from user
#And i’m writing a if statement with % and == operator
#if the result is 0, it prints the first print() function statement 
#else it’s prints the else print() function statement 

#This problem helps beginners understand:
#how to use input() function
#how to use operators % and ==
#how to use if-else statement

#Solution:
x = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if x % 2 ==0:
    print("This is an even number")
else:
    print("This is an odd number")
